# State Management

This document defines the state management patterns used throughout the system. Structure is provided in YAML format for AI parsing.

```yaml
state_management:
  agent_states:
    base_states:
      - initializing
      - ready
      - processing
      - error
      - shutdown
    
    project_consultant:
      states:
        - gathering_requirements
        - analyzing_input
        - generating_summary
        - complete
      transitions:
        - from: gathering_requirements
          to: analyzing_input
          trigger: requirements_complete

      states:
        - awaiting_summary
        - delegating_features
        - monitoring_progress

      transitions:

## State Transition Guidelines

1. **Agent State Management**
   - Use explicit state transitions
   - Validate state changes
   - Handle interrupted states
   - Maintain state history

2. **Persistence Strategy**
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Use vector store for semantic search
   - Implement backup mechanisms
   - Handle concurrent access
