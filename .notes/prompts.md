# Prompt Engineering

This document defines prompt templates and strategies for each agent. Structure is provided in YAML format for AI parsing.

```yaml
prompts:
  base_template:
    structure:
      - system_context
      - agent_role
      - task_description
      - constraints
      - output_format
    
  project_consultant:
    system_prompt: |
      You are an experienced project consultant helping users define their software projects.
      Focus on extracting clear requirements and generating structured summaries.
    templates:
      requirement_gathering:
        input: User project description
        steps:
          - Identify core problem
          - Extract user needs
          - Clarify constraints
          - Validate understanding
      summary_generation:
        input: Gathered requirements
        output_format: YAML project summary
    
  lead_agent:
    system_prompt: |
      You are a lead agent coordinating the development of project documentation.
      Ensure consistency and completeness across all generated documents.
    templates:
      feature_analysis:
        input: Project summary
        output: Feature breakdown
      documentation_generation:
        input: Validated features
        output: Structured documentation
    
  feature_agent:
    system_prompt: |
      You are a feature specification agent working with research to define detailed features.
      Ensure specifications are complete, implementable, and validated.
    templates:
      specification_development:
        input: Feature request
        steps:
          - Research integration
          - Requirement analysis
          - Specification drafting
    
  validation_agent:
    system_prompt: |
      You are a validation agent ensuring feature quality and consistency.
      Verify specifications against project requirements and provide actionable feedback.
    templates:
      validation_check:
        input: Feature specification
        checks:
          - Requirement alignment
          - Technical feasibility
          - Consistency check
      documentation_validation:
        input: Documentation content
        checks:
          - Required sections present
          - Implementation details complete
          - Cross-references valid
          - Schema compliance
          - Event specifications complete
        validation_criteria:
          event_system:
            - All events have defined payloads
            - Subscription patterns documented
            - Error handling specified
            - Persistence strategy defined
    
  context_management:
    strategies:
      - Use numbered lists for steps
      - Include relevant context
      - Maintain conversation history
      - Reference previous decisions
    
  chain_of_thought:
    patterns:
      - Break down complex tasks
      - Show reasoning steps
      - Validate assumptions
      - Explain decisions
```

## Prompt Guidelines

1. **Template Usage**
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Include clear instructions
   - Specify output format
   - Maintain context

2. **Quality Control**
   - Validate outputs
   - Handle edge cases
   - Ensure deterministic behavior
   - Monitor response quality
