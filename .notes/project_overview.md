# AI PRD Generator Project Overview

## Goal
Build an AI-powered system that generates and refines Product Requirements Documents using a multi-agent architecture.

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React/TypeScript web application
- **Backend:** Python-based agent system
- **State Management:** Event-driven with pubsub
- **Storage:** SQLite + FAISS for vector storage

## Key Components
1. **Agent System**
   - Lead Agent: Coordinates PRD generation
   - Feature Agent: Analyzes and defines features
   - Research Agent: Gathers relevant information
   - Validation Agent: Ensures quality
   - Memory Agent: Manages persistent storage

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for each agent
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - Mock LLM services for deterministic testing
   - Proper cleanup of pubsub subscriptions

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.13+
- Type safety throughout
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Proper error handling
